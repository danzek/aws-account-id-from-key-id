# Determine AWS Account ID from AWS Access Key ID

Decodes the AWS Account ID given an AWS Access Key ID (with a four-letter resource identifier beginning with "A"; this does not work for older key IDs beginning with "I" or "J").

# Usage

Coming soon....

# Rationale

## Isn't there a better way to do this?

Yes, use the AWS Security Token Service (STS) API call [`GetAccessKeyInfo`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccessKeyInfo.html). Example:

    aws sts get-access-key-info --access-key-id=<key-id-goes-here>

## Why write this when perfectly-good Python and Go implementations already exist?

I mainly wrote this as a Rust programming language learning exercise. I'm open to feedback both to learn more about Rust and better ways to implement this as well as to fix any bugs / logic errors in the code.
